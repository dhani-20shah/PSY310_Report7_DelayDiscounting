Key Idea:**
People tend to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards, even if waiting would result in a higher payoff.

### **Example:**
- Suppose you are given two options:
  - **Option A**: Receive ₹500 today.
  - **Option B**: Receive ₹1000 in one year.

  Many people would choose **Option A**, even though Option B gives more money, because they **discount** the future reward due to the waiting time.

### **Mathematical Representation:**
A common way to model delay discounting is using **hyperbolic discounting**:
\[
V = \frac{A}{1 + kD}
\]
Where:
- \( V \) = Present value of the reward
- \( A \) = Actual reward amount
- \( D \) = Delay time
- \( k \) = Discount rate (higher \( k \) means stronger preference for immediate rewards)

### **Real-World Applications:**
1. **Finance:** People often struggle with saving money because spending now is more rewarding.
2. **Health:** Choosing junk food over long-term fitness benefits.
3. **Addiction & Self-Control:** Impulsive behaviors (e.g., drug use) are linked to steep delay discounting.
